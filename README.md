Rogue Survivor Linux
====================
Rogue Survivor game original source code from 2012 adapted to run on linux
(does not work yet).


WHAT IS THIS
------------

This is a fork of the game source source from 2012, the goal is to make this
compile and run on linux. There are no data files or resources, you have to
download the game for that.


GET THE GAME
------------

The original blog where you can get the game is still alive, so go there:
http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com/
You'll need this for the resources (data files, images etc...)
